# WeatherApp project with API&GUI implementation.


To make it works, you have to get your own API from openweathermap.org/api, I used the free one and it's working perfectly fine.

How does it work?
1. Enter your desired city and click "Submit".

2. Enjoy the latest data (via OpenWeather.org) and proposed activities with their status:
  - green - great idea,
  - orange - might wanna wait for a better time,
  - red - change your plans.

# WeatherApp project with API&GUI implementation.


To make it work, you have to get your own API from openweathermap.org/api, I used the free one and it's working perfectly fine.

How does it work?
1. Enter your desired city and click "Submit".

1.1 If you clicked the 'wrench button', you can choose between the imperial and metric systems. If you didn't interact with that option, it sets the metric system as default.

2. Enjoy the latest data (via OpenWeather.org) and suggested activities with their status:
  - green - great idea,
  - orange - might want to wait for a better time,
  - red - change your plans.

2.1  If your chosen location doesn't exist, openweather.org can't find it, or some other error occurs, you will see a window with a message that explains the problem.

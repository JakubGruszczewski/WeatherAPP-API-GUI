# WeatherAPI+GUI


To make it work, you have to get your own API from openweathermap.org/api, I used the free one and its working perfectly fine.

How it works?
1. Enter your desired city and click "Submit".

2. Enojy latest data (via OpenWeather.org) and proposed activites with their status:
  - green - great idea,
  - orange - might wanna wait for a better time,
  - red - change your plans.
